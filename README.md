# PM2.5
PM2.5 is an increasing concern for environmental protection. In the spring and winter, many cities are suffering from great particles and having breath situations. This project used RNN( recurrent neural networks) and the LTSM(Long short-term memory) model to predict the PM2.5 level in Beijing using time series data.
